            <h2>Data Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our website may be used without entering personal information. Different rules may apply to certain services on our site, however, and are explained separately below. We collect personal information from you (e.g. name, address, email address, telephone number, etc.) in accordance with the provisions of German data protection statutes. Information is considered personal if it can be associated exclusively to a specific natural person. The legal framework for data protection may be found in the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG). The provisions below serve to provide information as to the manner, extent and purpose for collecting, using and processing personal information by the provider.</p>

            </p>
            <p> Please be aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to security risks and, therefore, complete protection against third-party access to transferred data cannot be ensured.</p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Our website makes use of so-called cookies in order to recognize repeat use of our website by the same user/internet connection subscriber. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and stores on your computer. They are used to improve our website and services. In most cases these are so-called "session cookies" that are deleted once you leave our website.</p>
            <p> To an extent, however, these cookies also pass along information used to automatically recognize you. Recognition occurs through an IP address saved to the cookies. The information thereby obtained is used to improve our services and to expedite your access to the website.</p>
            <p> You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.</p>

            <h3>Server Data</h3>
            <p>
                For technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files), is collected:

                - type and version of the browser you use
                - operating system
                - websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL)
                - websites that you visit
                - date and time of your visit
                - your Internet Protocol (IP) address.

                This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information you may have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it to any particular person. The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our website and services.
            </p>

            <h3>Purpose of Registering</h3>
            <p>We offer you the opportunity to sign up for our website. The information entered when signing up, as shown in the registration form</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mail address</li>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Phone numer</li>
                <li>Password</li>
            </ul>
            <p> is collected and stored solely for use by our website. When signing up for our website, we also store your IP address and the date and time you registered. This serves to protect us in the event a third party improperly and without your knowledge makes use of your data to sign up for our site.&nbsp;None of this information is transferred to third parties. Nor is any of this information matched to any information that may be collected by other components of our website.</p>

            <h3>Use of reCAPTCHA</h3>
            <p>In order to protect input forms on our site, we use the “reCAPTCHA” service of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter "Google." By means of this service it can be distinguished whether the corresponding input is of human origin or is created improperly by automated machine processing.</p>
            <p>To our knowledge, the referrer URL, the IP address, the behaviour of the website visitors, information about the operating system, browser and length of stay, cookies, display instructions and scripts, user input behaviour and mouse movements in the “reCAPTCHA” checkbox are conveyed to “Google.”</p>
            <p>Google uses the information obtained, among other things, to digitize books and other printed matter as well as to optimize services such as Google Street View and Google Maps (e.g. house number and street name recognition).</p>
            <p>The IP address provided as part of “reCAPTCHA” is not merged with other data from Google unless you are logged into your Google Account at the time the "reCAPTCHA" plug-in is used. If you want to prevent this transmission and storage of data by “Google” about you and your behaviour on our website, you must log out of “Google” before you visit our site or before using the reCAPTCHA plug-in.</p>
            <p>The use of the “reCAPTCHA” service is according to the Google Terms of Use:&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Information/Cancellation/Deletion</h3>
            <p>On the basis of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact us at no cost if you have questions relating to the collection, processing or use of your personal information, if you wish to request the correction, blocking or deletion of the same, or if you wish to cancel explicitly granted consent. Please note that you have the right to have incorrect data corrected or to have personal data deleted, where such claim is not barred by any legal obligation to retain this data.</p>
